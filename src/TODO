TODO:
(DONE) find out how to pass back the number of tokens to be "collapsed" from the stack (e.g. numbers collapse one but a binopnode could collapse 3 or more)


test single run parsing (i.e. get token from lexer. then shift to parse stack then run parser on stack)

get precedence to work


factor + factor * factor

(factor +) to be thing then (factor+ factor )
